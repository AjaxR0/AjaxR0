## About me

Hi, i don't know how you found my github but hello. I am Yui, a programmer and gamer whose objective is to achieve my goals in both hardware and software areas. 
I am currently on a professional IT course and i plan to keep following it and work afterwards.

I am still a student and i am studying: C (school) and Python.

## About my projects

I am the owner of Guren Ichinose and Darkness discord bots. Guren Ichinose is one of my biggest projects.
I also had modded minecraft networks which failed miserably because i am an alone developer and had no staff to help me back then.
